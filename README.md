**Password Validation System**

The Password Validation System is a Python-based application designed to ensure that users create strong and secure passwords. The system validates passwords against a set of predefined rules to enhance security and protect user accounts from potential threats.

**Key Features:**

Length Check: Ensures that the password is of a minimum length (e.g., at least 8 characters).
Uppercase Letters: Requires the password to contain at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Letters: Requires the password to contain at least one lowercase letter.
Digits: Requires the password to contain at least one numeric digit.
Special Characters: Requires the password to contain at least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, etc.).
No Spaces: Ensures that the password does not contain any spaces.

**Implementation Details:**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: The project uses Python's built-in libraries such as re for regular expressions.
